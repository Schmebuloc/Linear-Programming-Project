# Transfer War (MILP) — Transfer Window Optimization

This project formulates a football transfer window as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem.
We optimize buy/sell decisions for Real Madrid and FC Barcelona under budgets and squad constraints,
and compare Peace (γ=0) vs War (γ>0) scenarios using a denial term.
